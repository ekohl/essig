\chapter{Introduction}
The ESSIG (Embedded Systems SImulator Generator) project is aimed
towards automating the process of writing a simulator for a
microcontroller. This means that the essig system will generate a
working simulator from a specification of a microcontroller given by
the user in an input language. Secondary targets include making the
simulator suitable for debugging programs and having the ability to
join several microcontrollers together in a network
